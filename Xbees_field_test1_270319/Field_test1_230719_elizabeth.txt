Field test: Test the range of the xbees using turtle sim. Com 1 publishes joystick commands, com 2 receives and moves turtle.

Main things we tested when issues arised:
-Range/distance
-Antenna direction/line of sight
-XBEE/Antenna connection or disconnection 
-Analog/discrete data transmission

How we troubleshoot to test:
1. Test near range (all OK)
2. Test range by publishing while walking till reception stops. (all ok:250m)
3. Test code by facing antennas away from each other
4. Use XCTU to check if xbees could communicate

Field test 1 (Morning)

Conclusion: Only works speriodically
Condluded issue: Whenever there is a disconnection (antenna?), code does not resume.

Field test 1 (Afternoon)

Location: SP Arena Lvl 4 empty hall



SPArena-
Conclusion: Works well for analog and discrete

Field-
Conclusion: Works well across field and drizzle
