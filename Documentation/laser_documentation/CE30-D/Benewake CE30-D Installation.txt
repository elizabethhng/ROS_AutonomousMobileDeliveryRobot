In this folder are the files required in order to run install the CE30-D drivers and packages. The CE30-C and CE30-D require different packages. 


1. Configuring ethernet connection. 
Configure the ipv4 address as 192.168.1.81 on the laptop. To confirm that the laser is connected, ping 192.168.1.80


2. Installing CE30 drivers
This driver is required to run the ros packages shown subsequently, but has been taken off the internet. Hence, the ce30_driver provided by benewake can also be found in the "CE30-D info pack 5.22" zip fles under linux. 

To install the driver, extract "ce30_driver-master" (eg.~/Downloads/ce30_driver-master$ ) , then use the following commands.

Within the ce30_driver-master directory, run

	$ cmake . 

Where "." is the path to source. Afterwhich, run

	$ make

and then 

	$ sudo make install


3. Install the ROS packages

The ros packages required for the ce30-D can be found in the following link (or in the dropbox) 
https://github.com/martinappo/ce30-d_driver_ros it will produce pointcloud data. Install and run the launch file.

Additional notes:
The CE30-D ros driver publishes topics as sensor_msgs/PointCloud instead of sensor_msgs/PointCloud2, which is required to convert to sensor_msgs/LaserScan used for mapping purposes. To understand more about the differences in these two message types, refer to the following link (http://wiki.ros.org/pcl/Overview) .

Hence, the current structure is as such. point_cloud_converter is used to convert sensor_msgs/pointcloud to sensor_msgs/pointcloud2 (http://wiki.ros.org/point_cloud_converter), and pointcloud_to_laserscan is used to convert sensor_msgs/pointcloud2 to sensor_msgs/LaserScan (http://wiki.ros.org/pointcloud_to_laserscan)
 
CE30_ros_driver (sensor_msgs/PointCloud) --> point_cloud_converter (sensor_msgs/PointCloud2) --> pointcloud_to_laserscan (sensor_msgs/LaserScan).

The nodes have been put into the ce30_ros_driver static_demo.launch launch file. 

Hence, to run the benewake CE30-D, use the following command.

roslaunch ce30_driver_ros static_demo.launch

Laser data will then be published in the topic /scan, ready to be used for mapping.
