# ROS_AutonomousMobileDeliveryRobot

This repository was part of a project for a commercial client completed in 2019 and the release of code has been made available in 2022.
The autonomous mobile robot was built to autonomously navigate to a given location, and retrace the same path to return.
The repository contains only my contributions to the project over 8 months (part time) which includes the following features.
- Implementation of Laser and Pointcloud data
- Autonomous Navigation and Mapping (gmapping or hector)
- Waypoint collection and return path navigation
- Wireless communication from User Interface to Robot (Xbee serial)
- Simple User Interface (Pyqt)
